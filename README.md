# practice
I put some code that I studied.
I don't think these are not useful bun maybe I will laugh at my owful code.

Mnist_Linear is full-connected model to train Mnist datasets by Sequence model

Mnist_conv is Convolutional model to train Mnist datasets by Sequence model

The reason I use Sequence model is that personally easy to read and write
